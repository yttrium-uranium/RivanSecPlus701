Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are critical for maintaining efficiency, accountability, and compliance. Below are the Top 5 essential SOC SLAs commonly documented and enforced in top-tier SOC environments, along with brief descriptions:
Cybersecurity Operations Center (SOC), SLAs (Service Level Agreements) are critical to ensure consistent, timely, and measurable security response. Below are the Top 5 essential SLAs in a modern SOC, along with their most common time parameters (in minutes) for metrics such as MTTR, MTTD, etc.

🔹 1. MTTD – Mean Time to Detect
Description: The average time it takes from the occurrence of a security event to its detection by the SOC.
Purpose: Measures how fast threats are identified by the monitoring systems (SIEM, EDR, IDS).
Typical SLA Time:
High/Critical: ≤ 15 minutes
Medium/Low: ≤ 30–60 minutes

🔹 2. MTTA – Mean Time to Acknowledge / Triage
Description: The time from when an alert or incident is raised to when a SOC analyst acknowledges and begins triaging it.
Purpose: Ensures the SOC is actively responding to alerts in a timely fashion.
Typical SLA Time:
Critical alerts: ≤ 15 minutes
All other alerts: ≤ 30 minutes

🔹 3. MTTR – Mean Time to Respond / Resolve
Description: The average time to fully contain, eradicate, and recover from a security incident after detection.
Purpose: Measures SOC efficiency in remediating threats.
Typical SLA Time:

Critical incidents: ≤ 240 minutes (4 hours)
High: ≤ 480 minutes (8 hours)
Medium/Low: ≤ 1–3 business days

🔹 4. Threat Notification SLA
Description: Timeframe within which stakeholders (e.g., CISO, IT, legal) must be notified after confirmation of a security incident.
Purpose: Ensures timely escalation and compliance with regulatory timelines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Typical SLA Time:
Confirmed breach or critical incident: ≤ 60 minutes
Other security events: ≤ 120 minutes

🔹 5. Reporting SLA
Description: Defines the frequency and timeliness of SOC reports (incident summaries, threat intel, KPI dashboards).
Purpose: Maintains transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
Typical SLA Time:
Daily report of critical incidents: by end of business day (EOD)
Weekly incident summary: within Monday 12:00 PM
Monthly executive report: by the 3rd business day of each month
